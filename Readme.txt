---------------- TO-DO APP ----------------

I have build this application using some of the concepts in React like spread operators, useState Hook and maping components



If you're ran this locally in VS Code use the commands:
// fork the repo 
// to make the copy of it
// npm install
// to install the node modules and
// npm run dev
// to launch your react project in your browser
